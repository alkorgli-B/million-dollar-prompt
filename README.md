# 💰 Million Dollar Prompt

### The World’s Largest Collaborative AI Experiment

**1,000,000 words. $1 each. One massive AI prompt. What happens when a million minds write together?**

Buy a word for $1 — it joins a million others to form the largest collaborative AI prompt in human history. The AI responds in real-time, changing with every new word purchased. 30% of profits donated to children’s hospitals.

## 🧠 The Concept

Remember the [Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/) from 2005? A student sold 1 million pixels for $1 each and made internet history.

**Million Dollar Prompt** is the 2026 evolution — instead of pixels, we sell **words**. Every word purchased is permanently placed on a public grid and becomes part of one giant AI prompt. The AI generates a new response every 5 minutes, evolving as humanity writes together.

Nobody knows what the final output will be. That’s the point.
